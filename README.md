# fh-minesweeper
Follows the rules of windows xp minesweeper. Aka win as soon as only mines remain or all mines are marked (but not more).

On game over wrong marked fields are 'X'ed while correct markings remain flags.

To build the project into a zip file with executable use the gradle build jlink task.

I tested the code with zulu-17 and corretto-16 SDKs in IntelliJ
